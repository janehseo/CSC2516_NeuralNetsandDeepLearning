# Evaluating Performance and Robustness of 12-Channel ECG Classification Algorithms

Re-implemented CNN1D, InceptionTime, ResNet1D, and XResNet1D models that demonstrated good multi-class ECG classification performance with AUC > 90%, but showed models were susceptible to the
“Smooth Adversarial Perturbation” approach of attack.

Models were trained using the PTBXL data set: https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/
